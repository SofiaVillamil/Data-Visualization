# The World is Progressively Embracing Democracy

## Description
This project reproduces and enhances the *Our World in Data* visualization based on the classification of political regimes by Skaaning et al. (2015). It explores how democracy has spread across countries, its variations, and trends indicating whether the world is moving towards greater democratization.

## Project Details
- **Dataset Source**:  
  The data is sourced from *Our World in Data*, specifically the visualization available under the topic "Democracy" ([link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/countries-democracies-autocracies-lexical)).  
- **Dataset Features**:  
  The dataset categorizes nations into electoral democracies and autocracies using the *Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy* by Skaaning et al. (2015).  
- **Timeframe**:  
  Covers the period from 1789 to 2022, showing shifts in the number of democracies globally.  

## Objective
This visualization project replicates the original chart and introduces an additional improved version, enhancing both its design and analytical clarity to more effectively showcase the evolving landscape of global political systems.
